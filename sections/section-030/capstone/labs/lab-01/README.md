# Contain A Leaked Token Tree

- **ID:** CAPSTONE
- **Slug:** ats-115-capstone-030
- **Author:** Paris Nakita Kejser
- **Type:** Astrona graded lab

Graded lab for OpenBao in the namespace `openbao`. Read `question.md` for the task; `solution.md` is the walkthrough.
Built from the OpenBao 2.7 documentation and not yet run (see the repository `CLAUDE.md`).

## Run it

```sh
astrona run -c .
astrona submit
astrona destroy ats-115-capstone-030
```

`astrona destroy` takes the environment name (`metadata.name` = `ats-115-capstone-030`), not
the config path.

## Layout

| `bootstrap/02-seed-state.sh` | The starting state of the task: The token ci-parent with a child token build-1 and its certificates, an orphan release-bot, and a policy secret-id-issuer without wrapping rules |
| `manifests/` | Helm values for OpenBao and the tester pod |
| `solution/apply.sh` | Reference solution used by `astrona test` |
| `testing/wait-for-openbao.sh` | Waits until OpenBao answers unsealed |
